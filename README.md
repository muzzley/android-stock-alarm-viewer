android-stock-alarm-viewer
==========================

A project to test the retrieval and setting of alarms in Android's stock alarm app.
The code to interact with the stock alarm application is contained in the class [ClockController](https://github.com/muzzley/android-stock-alarm-viewer/blob/master/app/src/com/muzzley/stockalarmviewer/ClockController.java).

The interface has a text area with the next alarm configured and a button to set a new alarm five minutes from now.
